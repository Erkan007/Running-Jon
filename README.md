The software is a  desktop application and for entertainment purposes only. In the game, there will be our character, Jon Snow, trying to survive while blades, white walkers, and wildlings try to kill him. There will also be some bonuses for Jon to get bonus points. User input(key strokes) will control the characters position. Rest of the game flow is automated.
